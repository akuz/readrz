<h1>UK trade decifit narrows as exports surge to highest on record</h1>

Trade data comes as official figures show construction activity rebounded in second quarter, adding to economic optimism.

Britain's trade deficit narrowed in June, adding to a run of strong economic figures that show the UK economy recovering at its fastest rate since 2010.

Exports of goods in the second quarter of 2013 reached £78.4bn, the highest on record, spurred by a jump in sales to the US and China. Exports to non-EU countries have overtaken those within the EU, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

Trade in cars and machine parts to France and the Netherlands also improved in June, reducing the overall deficit in goods and services to £1.5bn from £2.6bn in May.
